# assembler
# a project to sum up the course: System programming laboratory
# the course is about learning C, writing machine-independent code and experimenting with medium scale projects.
# during this project, I have also experimented on code collaboration, since I wrote the project with my colleague @galpinto2
# you can find the project instructions under "Project Instructions.pdf"
