# assembler
An assembler project to sum up the course: System programming laboratory. (@ The Open University of Israel)<br />
The course is about learning C, writing machine-independent code and experimenting with medium scale projects.<br />
During this project, I have also experimented on code collaboration, since I wrote the project with my colleague @galpinto2<br />
You can find the project instructions under "Project Instructions.pdf"
